This is a much longer text file because I need something to be able to make major changes in.
Once upon a time there was a small Faun called Noly Faun.  He was a 'business' Faun and ran a very succesful outfit called Faun & Swindle from a large deserted barn at the bottom of the garden. A very popular (with all the small brothers) offshoot of F&S was a jazz cafe known as Faun and Swingle; the small fauns particularly liked the swinging chairs in the cafe and could frequently be found swaying in a chilled-out fashion to the hip beats and sipping large mugs of the used paint-water that Noly liked to call coffee.
F&S even had an on-line department: FandS.com.  Despite the many complaints from dissatisfied customers this was a roaring success and NOly raked in a large amount of money from it.
